# odin-recipes

This is my first project following The Odin Project course to teach web development.

Up until this point I have learned the basics of Git and the foundations of HTML. Using what I have learned in these two subjects I will demonstrate an understanding of both subjects from how the website is written and how the repository is managed.

The skills to showcase my understanding of these subjects are:

- Using atomic commits and writing messages that are concise and effective
- Making a website with proper formatting and use of elements and tags along with lists, links, and images
