      <li><small>1/2</small> cup toasted silvered almonds</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Place quinoa in a small saucepan and add 2<sup>1/4</sup> cup water. Bring mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. Lower heat to a simmer and cook covered for 15 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat. Allow the quinoa to rest in the saucepan for about 5 minutes, without opening the lid, to absorb all the liquid and steam. Uncover and fluff with a fork to separate the quinoa.</li>
      <li>In a shallow bowl, stir together 1 tablespoon olive oil along with the paprika, turmeric, coriander, onion powder, salt and pepper. Add chicken to the bowl and coat in the seasoning mixture.</li>
      <li>In a medium skillet over medium heat, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Transfer the chicken to the skillet and cook until the juices run clear, about 3-4 minutes per side. Remove from heat and allow it to cool, then slice each breast into strips.</li>
      <li>In the same skillet used to cook the chicken, add the kale and cook on medium-high heat until softened and charred, about 3-5 minutes, stirring frequently. You may have to cook in batches. Set aside.</li>
      <li>In the same skillet, add the cherry tomatoes and cook on medium-high heat until softened and charred, about 3-5 minutes, stirring frequently. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Assemble the chicken and quinoa bowls by dividing the quinoa, chicken, kale, tomatoes and almonds between four bowls. Garnish with chopped parsley and serve immediately.</li>
