    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a Lebanese style Beef Kafta recipe that's made with ground beef, parsley, onions and a blend of Middle Eastern spices- perfect on the grill or stove</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><small>1/4</small> cup parsley</li>
      <li>1 small yellow onion <i>quartered<i></i></li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons 7 spice</li>
      <li><small>1/2</small> teaspoon cumin</li>
      <li><small>1/2</small> teaspoon cinnamon</li>
      <li><small>1/2</small> teaspoon coriander</li>
      <li><small>1/8</small> teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li><small>1/2</small> teaspoon salt</li>
      <li><small>1/4</small> teaspoon black pepper <i>to taste</i></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Place the parsley in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until finely chopped, remove and set aside.</li>
      <li>In the same food processor bowl used to chop the parsley, place the quartered onion and pulse until finely chopped. Drain the onions slightly to release excess moisture.</li>
      <li>Return the parsley back to the bowl of the food processor with the onions. Add the ground beef to the food processor in addition to all the spices. Run the food processor on pulse once or twice until ingredients are well combined and form a pasty meat mixture.</li>
      <li>Transfer the mixture from the food processor to a large bowl and form the Kafta into an oblong shape about 1 inch in thickness. You can form them on a wooden skewer or without.</li>
      <li>Grease the grates of a gas grill or indoor grill pan, and preheat it to medium high heat. When heated through, transfer the kafta to the grill. Grill for 4-5 minutes per side, depending on your preferred level of doneness.</li>
      <li>Serve hot off the grill with your choice of side.</li>
    </ol>
