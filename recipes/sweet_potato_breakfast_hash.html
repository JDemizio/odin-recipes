    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. When the oil is almost smoking, add sweet potatoes, <small>1/4</small> teaspoon salt, garlic powder and paprika. Toss sweet potatoes to evenly coat in the oil, then spread into a single layer and cook, undisturbed, until browned and crisp on the bottom. Flip potatoes and continue to cook until crispy all around, about 10-12 minutes in total. Remove to a small plate and set aside.</li> 
      <li>Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil and red onion to the pan. Cook until onion softens, 1-2 minutes, then add kale and remaining <small>1/4</small> teaspoon salt. Cook until kale has wilted, about 2 minutes, then add sweet potatoes back in and toss to incorporate.</li>
      <li>Make 4 evenly spaced wells in the hash and crack an egg into each. Cover the pan until egg whites are set and egg yolks are cooked to your desired doneness, 5-7 minutes . Top with parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes.</li>
